### Front-end:
The html content is rendered on the client side using the [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) framework/library. React allow the developer to create the interactive parts of the app in JavaScript and render the html needed as well as change the html elements quickly making the application dynamic.

### Back-end:
The back-end server is built using [node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) - a node.js framework. The back-end serves as an API to the front end while the front-end does the navigation by rendering the various components.
